This is a strategy game played by two players on a 7 by 7 grid. 
Player A and Player B each take turns placing down an X or an O respectively, 
with a player winning when they have connected 5 pieces in a row. 
On any given turn a player can also choose to change the position 
of two of their existing pieces instead of placing a new piece.
