1. The data includes the year the surgery was performed; however, we did not account for
that in our model. What do you think would have happened if we also accounted for the
year the surgery was performed?
The later the surgery was performed, the more likely the patient would be to survive because of advancements in the medical field that have lead to higher survival rates.

2. What do the coefficients/weights for the model tell you about age and the number of
nodes in relation to survival rate?
Axillary nodes are much more detrimental to a patient's surivival rate than their age.
